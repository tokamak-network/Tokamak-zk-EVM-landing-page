Tokamak zkSNARK keeps proofs short and exceptionally easy to verify. It achieves competitive proof sizes compared to other universal SNARKs, with communication and computation efficiency that’s on par with state-of-the-art protocols.


Notably, when applied to verifiable machine computation, it delivers proofs that are **four to ten times smaller** than those from related works making it highly suitable for constrained environments.
For users and developers, this means:

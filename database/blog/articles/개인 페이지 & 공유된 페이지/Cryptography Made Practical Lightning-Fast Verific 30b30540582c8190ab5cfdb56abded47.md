# Cryptography Made Practical: Lightning-Fast Verification

Tokamak zkSNARK keeps proofs short and exceptionally easy to verify. It achieves competitive proof sizes compared to other universal SNARKs, with communication and computation efficiency that’s on par with state-of-the-art protocols.

Notably, when applied to verifiable machine computation, it delivers proofs that are **four to ten times smaller** than those from related works making it highly suitable for constrained environments.
For users and developers, this means:

- **Less Waiting Time:** Transactions and computations confirm almost instantly.
- **Lower Costs:** Proofs are cheaper to verify on-chain, leading to significant gas savings.
- **Massive Scalability:** Systems can handle far more activity without slowdown.
In short, Tokamak makes zero-knowledge efficient enough for real-world speed.
